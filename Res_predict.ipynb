      "  Phase 2 (Near-term deployment): 16 locations\n",
      "  HIGH priority locations: 15\n",
      "\n",
      "  EFFICIENCY BENEFITS:\n",
      "  - Single borehole samples multiple depth layers\n",
      "  - Reduced field deployment costs vs. layer-by-layer approach\n",
      "  - Captures high uncertainty from ALL layers simultaneously\n",
      "  - Maximizes information gain per field site\n",
      "\n",
      "Phase 5 - Field Campaigns:\n",
      "  1. Review COMBINED_optimal_survey_locations_ALL_LAYERS.csv\n",
      "  2. Deploy Phase 1 locations FIRST (immediate impact)\n",
      "  3. Focus on HIGH priority locations for maximum uncertainty reduction\n",
      "  4. Sample ALL depth layers at each borehole location\n",
      "  5. Install monitoring wells at multi-layer uncertainty hotspots\n",
      "\n",
      "Phase 6 - Model Validation & Refinement:\n",
      "  1. Collect resistivity data across all layers at survey locations\n",
      "  2. Validate predictions against new measurements for each layer\n",
      "  3. Retrain models with expanded multi-layer dataset\n",
      "  4. Quantify uncertainty reduction achieved across all layers\n",

      "Iterative Improvement:\n",
      "  - Expected uncertainty reduction: 40-80% per combined field campaign\n",
      "  - Target: Achieve <20% CV for critical areas across all layers\n",

    "UNITS AND MEANINGS:\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "1. {layer_name}_uncertainty_std [Ω·m]:\n",
    "   - Standard deviation of resistivity in original units\n",
    "   - Interpretation: ±1σ contains ~68% of probable values\n",
    "   - Example: 50 Ω·m means prediction ±50 Ω·m\n",
    "   - Use: Most statistically rigorous uncertainty measure\n",
    "\n",
    "2. {layer_name}_uncertainty_linear [Ω·m]:\n",
    "   - Linear approximation of uncertainty in original units\n",
    "   - Interpretation: Simpler approximation for small uncertainties\n",
    "   - Example: 30 Ω·m means prediction ±30 Ω·m (approximately)\n",
    "   - Use: Easier calculations, good for small uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "3. {layer_name}_uncertainty_range [Ω·m]:\n",
    "   - Half-width of 95% confidence interval in original units\n",
    "   - Interpretation: 95% CI = prediction ± range\n",
    "   - Example: 80 Ω·m means 95% CI spans ±80 Ω·m\n",
    "   - Use: Direct confidence interval interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. {layer_name}_uncertainty_factor [dimensionless]:\n",
    "   - Multiplicative uncertainty factor\n",
    "   - Interpretation: Prediction could be X× higher or lower\n",
    "   - Example: 1.5 means prediction could be 1.5× higher or lower\n",
    "   - Use: Relative uncertainty (independent of magnitude)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. {layer_name}_cv_percent [%]:\n",
    "   - Coefficient of variation as percentage\n",
    "   - Interpretation: Relative uncertainty as percentage\n",
    "   - Example: 25% means prediction ±25% relative uncertainty\n",
    "   - Use: Most intuitive for field teams and managers\n",
    "\n",
    "6. {layer_name}_ci_lower, {layer_name}_ci_upper [Ω·m]:\n",
    "   - 95% confidence interval bounds in original units\n",
    "   - Interpretation: 95% chance true value lies in this range\n",
    "   - Example: [150, 350] means true resistivity likely 150-350 Ω·m\n",
    "   - Use: Most useful for engineering decisions and risk assessment\n",
